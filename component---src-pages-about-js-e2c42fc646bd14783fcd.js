Users' lack of knowledge about IoT puts the privacy of their personal and sensitive data at risk. Reviewing how interconnected devices are communicated to users allows identifying and reporting which aspects should be covered to promote critical informed use. Communication about the operation of interconnected devices to users is scarce, technical and incomplete. The platforms used by users to understand and inform themselves on personal data are not offering an omni comprehensive communication on the topic.

Interconnected aims to visually show how data travels throught the ecosystem of smart objects and to do so dissects the ecosystems itself. The project takes its steps from the opacity of the communication of privacy concerns: smart objects are present in homes and rely on data capture to work. However, users’ privacy and security is not taken into account when talking about the benefit of these objects, that surely help to automate their lives. Interconnected wants to make people understand that inputs become data through algorithms and that this data crossed with the other devices’ one, creates a profile that matches the user and it is not clear where and how this data is used.\n",ordine:"secondo"},{title:"How was this project done? ↴",content:"The project was designed after a research on smart objects used in homes.

Data can not be obtained without a sensor capable of sensing temperature, motion, humidity or acceleration. A sensor is a device able to sense changes in the environment it is put in. A sensor by itself is worthless, but when it is used in an electronic device, it plays a vital role. A sensor can calculate a physical phenomenon (like temperature, strain, etc.) and translate it into an electrical signal: sensors are input devices which provide an output (signal) concerning a specific physical quantity (input).",diag:d,ordine:"terzodue"},{title:"⟶ COMPANIES",content:"The research and the analysis conducted to understand the IoT ecosystem has made evident that the opacity of the path of data is an obstacle in the understanding of the matter. To investigate where data goes and if there were connections between companies, the archive of IoT devices found on three websites was considered: *Privacy Not Included by Mozilla, IoT Line Up and PostScapes. Leaving out the repetitions between the websites, a total of 216 devices were found. Each device was searched on Google.com looking for the manufacturer. The manufacturer company was then searched again on Google.com and on Crunchbase.com in order to obtain the name of the holding company. With this data, a dendrogram visualisation was created and the main finding of this representation is that looking only at the holdings is not enough to understand the real link behind devices and companies.

In order to pursue this aim, the starting point was showing images with devices and asking which devices were known, which were owned, which devices captured personal data and which personal data was taken in their opinion. From the survey answers arose to two conclusions: there is a lack of knowledge about personal data taken from interconnected devices, and secondly, familiarity with devices, in terms of ownership and interaction, is not sufficient nor decisive for IoT literacy.",diag:h,ordine:"terzoquattro"},{title:"⟶ OPACITY",content:"In the case of Interconnected, there were two types of opacity: the one related to the path of data and the one related to the data itself.

Therefore, the opacity of the path was represented with both the use of a dotted line and multiple path combinations from the starting to the arrival point. The opacity of the data, on the other hand, was represented with the blur of the elements that visualise the data.
